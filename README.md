"remittance advices"</h2>
<h3>Using wise words to help other people, that's what I personally think advice is. you don't need to be smart or fully mature.</h3>
<h4>At schools, there are counselors that you can go to. I've visted that room more than 5 times. They aren't professional, but they do help when it comes with calming you down</h4>
<h5>The fact that there's tons of people who don't ask for help confuses and depresses me. there are people who try to do everything by themselves when they know they can't.</h5>
<h6>It's okay to ask for help, it's okay to cry, it's okay to be afride, but it's not okay to isolate yourselve and convice yourselve you can to itby yourselve. Don't feel ashamed for you a not alone dealing with hardships.</h6>
<h7>For example, depression. The darkness and the feeling of being numb isn't the best. when you know it's getting worse, find help. No need to be embarassed, depression isn't something for you to get embarassed about. You have to get yourselve out before you get pushed into the big dark hole.'</h7>
<h6>everyone matters in this world. I don't know how many times people have told you or how many times you heard this, but everything changes in small ways if you go. there are people who care for you. you might not knowor see, but deep inside, there are peole who sees you as a important person in this world. not likeing this cruel world is fine. I agree with you. if you dont want to life in this world, this again for the second time. when gone, what will happen after.</h6>
<h8>Tears, pain, and maybe even regret. These woud be the total highlight after "your" incident.</h8>
<br>
<br>
<h9>This whole page isn't meant for putting pressure at all. I'm supporting you and other people to ask for help. This is where adivce comes in.</h9>
<br>
<br>
<h10>Wise words?</h10>
<br>
<br>
<h11>Words are as powerful as physical contact. you have to be careful with the words that come out of your mouth. they can slip out and make you regret.</h11>
<br>
<br>
<h12>What you say can affect someone ina second. If you say someing hurtful, their mood wouldn't be good. do the opposite and they wold either be smiling or maybe get some confidence. the main point is that words can affect people easily. as a human, the emotins that goes everywhere in you can change instantly.</h12>
<br>
<br>
<h13>Changing the subject abit, you can get wise words from someone that lived in this world longer than you because they have some kid experience. plus, they are older, right?</h13>
<br>
<br>
<h14>[Maybe not someone 3years younger than you though. i would suggest grandparents or parents. they might be the most helpful, not including professional therapists]</h14>
